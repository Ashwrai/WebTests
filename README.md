# Web Testing Repository
This repository is dedicated to the practical assignment focused on testing a web page using various techniques introduced in the latter part of the course. The task involves working in pairs over two practice sessions, approximately spanning a month. Just like the previous practice, this assignment is conducted from a private GitHub repository, distinct from the first one, granting access to the designated professors (tbvaliente).

### Task Description:

- **Objective**: To conduct testing on a chosen website, emphasizing its core functionalities.
- **Website Criteria**: The selected website should be in HTML/JavaScript format to enable interaction with Selenium WebDriver.
- **Testing Focus**: Emphasis is placed on critical actions of the website, such as user data editing, product purchase interactions, and content validation.
- **Testing Types**: UI testing will be conducted, treating the web interface as a black-box.
- **Automation**: Selenium WebDriver will be utilized for automating various actions on the website.
- **Test Case Definition**: Test cases will be defined using Gherkin language, leveraging the Cucumber framework for Java.
- **Methodology**: The assignment follows the Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) methodology, emphasizing reusability of step definitions across different test scenarios.

### Repository Structure:

- **Test Scripts**: Java files containing test scripts implemented using Selenium WebDriver and the Cucumber framework.
      - **Features**: Gherkin files that define the steps to take for each case scenario.
      - **Steps**: Java files containing the implementation of each step of the Features.
